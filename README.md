# Analyzing the Changing Distributions of Cyclist Casualties in New York City
## Introduction
I performed this analysis as part of the [Transportation Data Science Project (TDSP)](https://nebigdatahub.org/nsdc/tdsp/), which provides self-paced instruction on the basics of python and data science using a New York City OpenData transportation dataset on car crashes. The project culminates with participants selecting and original research question, conducting data analysis to answer the question, and creating a poster to present their findings.

I decided to examine cyclist causialties (i.e., injuries and fatalities) before and after the COVID-19 pandemic to identify trends that the pandemic may have caused and recommend actions to address them.
